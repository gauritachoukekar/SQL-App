3.Use Case Analysis
Order and User Management
•	Queries like "Retrieve All Orders With Buyer Details" and "Show Order History for a Specific User" are essential for tracking customer orders and understanding their purchasing behavior. This data helps in improving customer engagement and marketing strategies.
Product and Store Management
•	Queries such as "List Products Available in a Specific Store" and "Find Most Popular Product Based on Orders" help store owners manage their inventories and identify products that are performing well. This allows businesses to optimize stock levels and marketing campaigns.

User Insights and Preferences
•	By counting "Total Number of Buyers and Sellers" and showing products in the "Shopping Cart for a User," the business can gain insights into customer behavior, tailor personalized offers, and enhance user experience.
Logistics and Delivery Tracking
•	Queries related to delivery addresses and shipping, such as "Show Delivery Addresses for Orders," ensure that businesses can monitor the status of deliveries and improve logistics efficiency.
